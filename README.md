This is code for "weeds standalone", which is used to identify and model millimeter-wave radio emission from molecules.

It was given to me (T. Rice) by K. Zhang in May 2016.
I am not aware of where the code ultimately comes from, but I believe it's related to the python source within "weeds" in gildas.

I am not the developer of "weeds" and do not take any credit for this original weeds code.

Notes
=====

K. Zhang said that she had deleted some of the interface code.
She changed the 'modsource' to output not only brightness temperature but also intensity (in Jy units).
